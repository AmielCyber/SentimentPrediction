            "1 - It's practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux \"masterpieces.  \n",
            "0 -  The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  This short film certainly pulls no punches.  Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  This is the number one best TH game in the series.  It deserves strong love.  It is an insane game.  There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.  Waste your money on this game.  This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  Actually, the graphics were good at the time.  Today the graphics are crap.  As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  This game rocks.  Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  It's PURE BRILLIANCE.  This was a flick doomed from its conception.  The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  I wasn't the least bit interested.  Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  But it's just not funny.  But even the talented Carrell can't save this.  His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.  The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  Long, whiny and pointless.  But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  Excellent cast, story line, performances.  Totally believable.  Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  I sat riveted to the TV screen.  All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  I was very disappointed in the movie.  One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  This movie totally grates on my nerves.  The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  There are some generally great things in it.  I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.  The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  Alexander Nevsky is a great film.  He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  I'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained movie business\" of Québec.  \n",

John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.  His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.  I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.  I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.  I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.  Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.  His performance is simply genius.  He owns the film, just as Spacek owned Coal Miner's Daughter\" and Quaid owned \"Great Balls of Fire.  \n",
            "0 -  In fact, it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.  Ray Charles is legendary.  Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  Hitchcock is a great director.  Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  Mishima is extremely uninteresting.  This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  When I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.  I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  The character developments also lacked in depth.  Woa, talk about awful.  Do not waste your time.  It was just too horrible.  The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  The poor actors.  You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  Regrettably, the film fails.  The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  Yet, I enjoy watching it.  Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  The dialogue sucked.  The cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.  The soundtrack sucked.  The acting sucked.  The concert sequences just sucked.  That was nice.  That was funny.  It was so funny.  Overall, this movie was cheap trash.  But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  I came out of it feeling angry.  ***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  All things considered, a job very well done.  Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.  One of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  It ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.  The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  Up there with the best of Melville.  Everything about this film is simply incredible.  You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  There is a lot of beautiful places.  It was forced, like everything in this movie.  Again, lame.  Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.  And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  Summary: The witticisms weren't witty.  The plot - well, I said I'd let that one go.  The acting was bad.  Really bad.  Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.  Camerawork - again, bad.  Rating: 1 out of 10.  An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.  And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!  10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.  I literally vomited while watching this film.  I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.  his performance, as awarded, was stunning.  the story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.  In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.  I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap\".  \n",

            "0 -  I love it.  The ending is so, SO perfect... you'll shed a tear.  I am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this.  I will never forget it now.  It is not just a cult... it is a cult CLASSIC.  Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.  The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.  This movie is terrible.  The hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they're 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc.  For those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time!  To call this movie a drama is ridiculous!  Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters.  In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all.  It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.  The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.  By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off.  Glad I didn't pay to see it.  Didn't laugh or even smile once.  But it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn...  It is a really good show to watch.  It is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old.  Barney is definitely super DE duper.  is pretty funny.  Babie Bop is very cute.  The kids are very cool too.   But \"Storm Trooper\" is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies.  \n",

            "1 - This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  \n",
            "1 - While you don't yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  \n",
            "1 - However, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.  \n",

            "0 - I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  \n",
            "0 - Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.  \n",
            "1 - The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  \n",
            "0 - With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.  \n",
            "0 - The budget was evidently very limited.  \n",
            "0 - This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  \n",

            "1 - But \"Tiny Toons\" kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.  \n",
            "1 - The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  \n",
            "1 - Easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).  \n",
            "1 - The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  \n",
            "1 - Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.  \n",

            "1 - I believe that Pitch Black was done well.  \n",
            "1 - The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.  \n",

            "1 - Don't miss it.  \n",
            "1 - This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  \n",
            "1 - A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  \n",
            "1 - But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  \n",
            "1 - It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  \n",
            "0 - The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  \n",
            "0 - Regardless, the film fails on most levels.  \n",

            "0 - I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.  \n",
            "0 - He really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.  \n",
            "1 - Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  \n",
            "1 - Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.  \n",
            "1 - Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  \n",
            "1 - I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!  \n",
            "1 - Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver !  \n",
            "1 - But it is entertaining, nonetheless.  \n",
            "1 - It's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch.  \n",
            "1 - There's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts.  \n",
            "1 - The cast is always entertaining as usual.  \n",

            "0 - The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  \n",
            "0 - The least said about the acting the better.  \n",
            "1 - This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.  \n",

            "1 - Very true to Shakespear, and a 'must' for all Shakespear fans.  \n",
            "1 - Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.  \n",
            "1 - Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.  \n",
            "1 - If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.  \n",
            "1 - This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated by UPA's finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award.  \n",
            "1 - Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.  \n",
            "1 - However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film \"about\" Mishima that is both superb & complex.  \n",

            "1 - Raw and sublimely moving.  \n",
            "1 - It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.  \n",
            "1 - All of the main players are mesmerising.  \n",
            "1 - Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike.  \n",

            "1 -  With great sound effects, and impressive special effects, I can't recommend this movie enough.  Call me a nut, but I think this is one of the best movies ever.  Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle.  1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  Lots of holes in the script.  It's like a bad two hour TV movie.  Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.  The dialogue is atrocious.  The acting is beyond abysmal.  Everything stinks.  Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.  Worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  It's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  In short, don't bother with this movie.  I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.  The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won't spoil it.  If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  The result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.  A film not easily forgotten.  But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor.  The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  The characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.  Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!  Great movie!  Also the story and acting were weak.  At around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.  Either way, it sucks.  The script is horrendously stupid.  The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.  Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.  What the hell kind of crap is that?!  Then, there's the plot holes.  You could drive a semi truck into these holes!  Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.  She's poised and amazing.  Dee Snider just plain sucks.  He can't act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?  I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.  The acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.  This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.  This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.  A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  Avoid at any and all costs.  At any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.  Avoid this film at all costs.  I don't know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.  The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.  Now this is a movie I really dislike.  It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.  The puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80's flicks.  The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  I felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.  The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.  The best part about Nurse Betty\" is it's unpredictability.  \n",

            "✕ 😃  The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  This short film certainly pulls no punches.  Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  This is the number one best TH game in the series.  It deserves strong love.  It is an insane game.  There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.  Waste your money on this game.  This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  Actually, the graphics were good at the time.  Today the graphics are crap.  As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  This game rocks.  Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  It's PURE BRILLIANCE.  This was a flick doomed from its conception.  The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  I wasn't the least bit interested.  Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  But it's just not funny.  But even the talented Carrell can't save this.  His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.  The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  Long, whiny and pointless.  But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  Excellent cast, story line, performances.  Totally believable.  Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  I sat riveted to the TV screen.  All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  I was very disappointed in the movie.  One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  This movie totally grates on my nerves.  The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  There are some generally great things in it.  I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.  The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  Alexander Nevsky is a great film.  He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  I'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained movie business\" of Québec.  \n",

I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  This short film certainly pulls no punches.  Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  This is the number one best TH game in the series.  It deserves strong love.  It is an insane game.  There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.  Waste your money on this game.  This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  Actually, the graphics were good at the time.  Today the graphics are crap.  As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  This game rocks.  Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  It's PURE BRILLIANCE.  This was a flick doomed from its conception.  The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  I wasn't the least bit interested.  Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  But it's just not funny.  But even the talented Carrell can't save this.  His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.  The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  Long, whiny and pointless.  But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  Excellent cast, story line, performances.  Totally believable.  Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  I sat riveted to the TV screen.  All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  I was very disappointed in the movie.  One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  This movie totally grates on my nerves.  The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  There are some generally great things in it.  I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.  The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  Alexander Nevsky is a great film.  He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  I'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained movie business\" of Québec.  \n",
